[**Genizer**](https://www.genizer.com/), located in Technology Link in Greater Los Angeles, 
is dedicated to advancing homogenizer nanotechnology. 

We provide [**high pressure homogenizers**](https://www.genizer.com/c/high-pressure-homogenizer_0360), [**liposome extruders**](https://www.genizer.com/c/liposome-extruder_0365), [**diamond interaction chambers**](https://www.genizer.com/c/diamond-interaction-chamber_0118),
and high pressure gauges compatible with other brands of high pressure homogenizers and high pressure pumps.

**Genizer technology** can be applied to nanomedicine, such as nanoparticles, nanoemulsions, liposomes, vaccines, gene delivery systems, as well as cell disruption, graphene and nanotube. **NanoGenizer**, a high pressure homogenizer for nanotechnology, helps scientists to achieve uniform nanoemulsions and uniform particle size reduction, seamless scale-up and unparalleled repeatability

## What is homogenization?

Homogenization, or homogenisation, is any of several processes used to make a mixture of two mutually non-soluble liquids the same throughout. This is achieved by turning one of the liquids into a state consisting of extremely small particles distributed uniformly throughout the other liquid. In other words, homogenization is the process of converting two immiscible liquids into an emulsion. 

**Genizer** homogenization technology applies a microfluidics **Diamond Interaction Chamber (DIXC)** to produce uniform nanoparticles in high shear homogenizers. The processed fluid passes through the fixed geometry within the Y-type and Z-type microfluidics chamber (which can also be considered a continuous microreactor) to create a uniform processing profile. Through this method, oil-in-water and water-in-oil nanoemulsions (100â€“1000 nm) can be produced.
