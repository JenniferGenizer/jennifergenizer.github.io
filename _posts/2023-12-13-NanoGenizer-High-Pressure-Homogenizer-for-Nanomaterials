## Using NanoGenizer High Pressure Homogenizers for Cell Disruption and Nanomaterials

NanoGenizer, a lab-scale microfluidic high pressure homogenizer, offers effective performance on particle size reduction and cell disruption. It utilizes interaction high-pressure microfluidic jet technology, and equipped with highly modular power and processing units. NanoGenizer is suitable for rare and valuable samples because of its minimum dead volume design and its continuous flow rate, which enables it to process up to 120 mL/min. With successful applications in various nanotechnology settings, the NanoGenizer has gained increasing recognition due to its notable shear rate, excellent repeatability, and guaranteed scalability.
 
NanoGenizer provides efficient solutions for various nanomaterials, including: liposomes, nano-emulsions, nano-crystals, micelles, lipid nanoparticles, cosmetic nano-encapsulation materials, nano-particle dispersion, graphene, carbon nanotube, and more. As more organizations recognize this, NanoGenizer is becoming an essential high pressure homogenizer for laboratories working on high-end nanomaterial preparation.
