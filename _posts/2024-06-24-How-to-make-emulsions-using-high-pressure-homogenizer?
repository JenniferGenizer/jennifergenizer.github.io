### Nanoemulsions offer benefits for extracting oils and active ingredients by:

① Enhancing bioavailability and decreasing response time, dosage, and side effects.
② Masking the unpleasant taste of the extracted oil.
③ Creating translucent droplets smaller than 100nm.

An emulsion is a biphasic system where one phase is dispersed in another as tiny droplets with diameters up to 100μm. A nanoemulsion, on the other hand, is a colloidal dispersion comprising oil and surfactant that can potentially enhance the bioavailability of active agents. In addition to the primary excipients, nanoemulsions may also contain membrane stabilizers, co-emulsifiers, taste blockers, pH modifiers, osmotic adjusters, and antioxidants. The droplet size of nanoemulsions typically ranges from 20 to 200 nm, making them transparent due to their small size.

### **The four steps for preparing nanoemulsions are:**

1. Mixing the emulsifier and oil with a stirrer.
2. Homogenizing the mixture to form nanoemulsions.
3. Sterilizing by filtration at 0.22μm.
4. Conducting quality analysis using a particle sizer.

While sonication is effective for small batch nanoemulsions, it is not especially suitable for processing large quantities of certain types of tissues.

The NanoGenizer, a high-pressure homogenizer, is able to produce nanoemulsions with the combined forces of microfluidization and shear. NanoGenizer maximizes particle reduction, speeds up processing and lowers the time and overall cost of production.

Not only can high-pressure homogenizers be used for large batches production of nanoemulsions, they can be set up as part of an inline process, allowing mixing, homogenization, sterilization of large volumes of nanoemulsions without interruption.

Genizer offers the NanoGenizer high-pressure homogenizer for preparation and online sterile filtering for sterilization of nanoemulsions without interruption. In addition, Genizer also provides the light scattering particle sizer for measuring the size of nanoemulsions.

### Formulating Nanoemulsions
To formulate nanoemulsions, start by mixing an emulsifier with oil using a stirrer, followed by homogenizing the sample, sterilizing it, and then measuring it.

### Homogenizing Nanoemulsions
Homogenize nanoemulsions by processing them through a homogenizer such as a NanoGenizer.

### Sterilizing Nanoemulsions
Sterilize nanoemulsions by filtering them with a sterile filter of 0.22μm pore size.

### Measuring the Size of Nanoemulsions
Measure the size of nanoemulsions using a light scattering particle sizer.
