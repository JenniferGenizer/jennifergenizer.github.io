Nanoemulsions provides advantage for extract oil and active ingredients with low bioavailability by: 
① Increase bioavailability; reduce response time, dose and adverse effects
② Mask the taste of the extract oil
③ Produce translucent droplet sizes less than 100nm
An emulsion is a biphasic system in which one phase is dispersed in the other phase in the form of minute droplets with diameter up to100μm. Among the emulsion, nanoemulsions is colloidal dispersion form including oil and surfactant that can potentially improve the bioavailability of many active agents. Besides main excipients, the nanoemulsions can also include membrane stabilizer, co-emulsifier, taste-blocker, pH modifier, osmotic adjuster and anti-oxidant. The droplet size of nanoemulsions fall typically in the range 20-200 nm. Because of small size, nanoemulsions are transparent. 



The preparation of nanoemulsions includes ① mixing emulsifier and oil with stirrer; ② homogenizing to nanoemulsions; ③ sterilization by filtration with 0.22μm; ④ quality analysis by particle sizer.

While sonication is effective for small batch nanoemulsions, it is not especially suitable for processing large quantities of certain types of tissues.
NanoGenizer, high pressure homogenizer, in particular, are able to be produce nanoemulsions with a combinational forces of microfluidization and shear, with maximize particle reduction, speed processing and lower the time and overall cost of production.
Not only can high pressure homogenizers be used for large batches production of nanoemulsions, they can be set up as part of an inline process, allowing the mixing, homogenization, sterilization of large volumes of nanoemulsions without interruption.
Genizer provides, NanoGenizer high pressure homogenizer for preparation and online steric filter for sterilization of nanoemulsions without interruption.  In addition, Genizer also provide the light scattering particle sizer for measurement the size of nanoemulsions.
