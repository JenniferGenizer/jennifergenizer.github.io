# How to select a high pressure homogenizer?

### 6.1 Selecting a high pressure generator

Overall, a cylinder with an intensifier is superior to a direct-drive one.

Under the same flow rate, higher pressure produces lower frequency, fewer pressure fluctuations, better product quality, and greater equipment durability. At 30,000 psi, Genizer's laboratory high pressure homogenizer, Nanogenizer3, can reach fluctuation levels of less than 10 Hz, as opposed to 60 Hz from a normal homogenizer.

High pressure piston materials can be divided into ceramics, tungsten carbide, and hardened stainless steel, with ceramics as the costliest option and hardened stainless steel as the most affordable. Quality and durability align with cost: Ceramic materials offer the highest quality, followed by hard tungsten alloy, with hardened stainless steel as a lower-quality option.

### 6.2 Selecting homogenization parts

As a core component of homogenizers, homogenization chambers play a decisive role in achieving optimum results for the process. Different inner constructions of homogenization chambers lead to different results and applications.

Properties	Description	First generation Figure A & Figure B Impact type	Second generation Figure C Interaction type
Efficiency	Performance	Moderate	Good
Multi-Channel	Scale-up guarantee	Moderate	Good
Multi-Stage	Enhance performance	Dual stage	Single stage
Adjustable	Optimize performance	Adjustable	Fixed
Cooling	Biological applications	None	Yes
 
 
When selecting a suitable homogenizer, the purchaser must consider both performance and cost. In general, the cost of the first-generation homogenization chamber is more economical, but its performance in the homogenization process is not as good as the second generation’s. The second-generation homogenization chamber produces a superior product, but when processing materials with high concentration and viscosity, it is more likely to block than first-generation machines, and its cost is higher as well. The interaction chamber with a cooling system, developed by Genizer, can be used for thermally unstable biological and pharmaceutical products. 

### 6.3 Maximum homogenizing pressure

In general, higher homogenizing pressure leads to better quality. This is because the particle size will be much smaller and more uniform if the homogenizer’s pressure is higher, which means processors produce the nanomaterial more efficiently. Higher homogenizing pressure also allows more kinds of samples to be processed. For example, emulsions usually require a homogenizing pressure of 20,000 psi to achieve a particle size of 100 nm, while suspensions usually require at least 45,000 psi to reach nanoscale.

It should also be noted that high temperature will affect the results of the homogenization process. The higher the pressure is, the higher the temperature will be. Because of this, 30,000 psi is the maximum pressure for high pressure homogenization without a cooling system. Due to the high temperature, the homogenization effect of more than 30,000 psi does not increase with pressure. The development of the ultra-high pressure diamond interaction chamber with a cooling system can effectively reduce the content of large particles and solve the problem of emulsion stability caused by high temperature. Therefore, machines equipped with this type of chamber can achieve pressures up to 60,000 psi.

### 6.4 Product uniformity

Generating a uniform particle size distribution is quite important during the production process. A wide distribution of particle size from nanometer to micron not an acceptable result, especially if particles larger than 5 um are present in a pharmaceutical emulsion. USP (US Pharmacopeia) regulates the particle size distribution of pharmaceutical emulsions. Interaction chambers produce a more uniform particle size distribution than impact valve homogenizers.
